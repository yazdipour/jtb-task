Problem
To build and release a documentation archive, a developer generates a Maven project's
Javadoc, downloads the latest release notes from a marketing team's website, creates an
archive and submits it to QA, everything from a local machine. Such a build procedure is
tedious, unreliable and not secure. We definitely can do better.
Goal
Let's automate the release procedure with TeamCity and make a distribution archive
byte-to-byte reproducible. The only required input for a TeamCity build should be a commit hash
of the project's Git repository. Build should not fail if the marketing website isn't available.
Details
It's assumed that the marketing team's processes cannot be changed;
Release notes may be modified by the marketing team anytime;
What Maven project and Git hosting to use are up to you;
TeamCity build settings should be stored in Kotlin format;
A deployment should be described in code, both Docker Compose and Kubernetes are
acceptable options;
